## Dataset Summary and Key Insights

The dataset selected for this project is the **Heart Disease UCI dataset**, which contains 14 attributes and 303 patient records related to heart health indicators. The primary goal is to analyze factors contributing to the presence of heart disease.

Key attributes include age, sex, chest pain type, resting blood pressure, cholesterol level, maximum heart rate achieved, and exercise-induced angina.

**Key insights from exploratory data analysis (EDA):**

* The distribution of the target variable (presence or absence of heart disease) is relatively balanced.
* Chest pain type shows a strong association with heart disease diagnosis.
* Age and maximum heart rate also correlate moderately with heart disease presence.
* Cholesterol and resting blood pressure exhibit wide variability and require normalization.
* Some features exhibit missing or zero values that are physiologically unlikely, indicating data noise.

## Data Cleaning and Exploration Steps

1. **Loading and Inspecting Data:**

   * Loaded dataset into a Pandas DataFrame and inspected data types, missing values, and basic statistics.

2. **Handling Missing and Noisy Data:**

   * Imputed missing cholesterol values with median to avoid bias.
   * Removed duplicate rows to ensure data integrity.
   * Filtered out entries with invalid zero cholesterol values to reduce noise.

3. **Exploratory Visualizations:**

   * Created count plots for categorical features such as chest pain type and the target variable.
   * Visualized distributions of continuous variables like age and cholesterol.
   * Computed and visualized correlation matrix to understand feature relationships.

## Challenges and Solutions

* **Missing Data:** The dataset contained missing values in critical columns. This was addressed by median imputation, preserving the dataset size without introducing strong biases.
* **Noisy Data:** Certain records had unrealistic zero cholesterol values, which were removed to prevent skewing model performance.
* **Feature Identification:** Identifying the correct target variable and understanding categorical versus continuous features required careful inspection and domain knowledge.
* **Environment Restrictions:** Installation of libraries like pandas and seaborn was not possible directly inside some notebook environments, requiring setup outside the notebook.
